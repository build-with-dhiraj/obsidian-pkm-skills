## What is the Obsidian Graph Auditor?

`obsidian-graph-auditor` is a command-line tool that **audits your Obsidian vault** and **scores your second brain** on eight dimensions of PKM graph health. It is read-only, pure Python, and does not need GPT, an API key, or an Obsidian plugin. Point it at any markdown directory that uses `[[wikilinks]]` (Obsidian, Logseq, Foam, Quartz) and it returns a letter-graded scorecard backed by expert-cited thresholds.

**What it measures:**
- link density (edges per note)
- orphan rate and near-orphan rate
- connected-2plus share
- top-hub edge-share and top-hub:next ratio
- Louvain modularity
- frontmatter-wikilink adoption

Each dimension grades A-F against a threshold from the network-science and PKM canon (kepano, Matuschak, Ahrens, Konik, Paranyushkin, Milo, Newman). A vault is **Grade A** only if every dimension is A. The worst dimension is the overall grade — by design, so you always see the highest-leverage fix.

## Why your Obsidian vault needs an audit

Most Obsidian vaults rot silently. Notes accumulate, links don't, and the graph view becomes a hairball of orphans around one mega-hub. The graph view is great for staring at, but it isn't a measurement. You can't tell from a hairball whether your vault is healthy or whether the entire structure is collapsing around one dominant tag.

Established PKM and network-science work gives us specific thresholds. kepano's "Properties as links" convention puts typed metadata in the graph and expects high frontmatter-wikilink adoption. Andy Matuschak's evergreen-notes practice keeps every note "well-connected on multiple sides" — empirically, a link density of 4-10 edges per note. Konik's PKM-as-graph framing treats orphan rate as a capture-to-connection ratio: above 10% means you're collecting faster than you're integrating. Dmitry Paranyushkin's InfraNodus and Newman's modularity work pin the healthy community-structure band at 0.4-0.65. Below 0.4 your vault has no coherent topics; above 0.65 your topics are siloed islands.

An auditor turns those thresholds into a single number — a score, a grade, a CI gate to pass before declaring your second brain Grade A. It answers, with citations: **Is my Obsidian healthy? What's a good orphan rate? How many hubs should a vault have?**

## The 8-dimension Grade-A rubric

| # | Dimension | Healthy range | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Link density (edges/note) | 4-10 | network-science consensus; kepano |
| 2 | Orphan rate (degree 0) | < 10% | Konik PKM-as-graph |
| 3 | Near-orphan rate (degree 1) | < 15% | derived complement |
| 4 | Connected ≥2 share | > 75% | derived |
| 5 | Top-hub edge-share | < 5% | power-law avoidance; Milo motifs |
| 6 | Top-hub : next-hub ratio | < 2.0 | concentration check |
| 7 | Louvain modularity | 0.40-0.65 | Newman; Paranyushkin (InfraNodus) |
| 8 | Frontmatter-wikilink adoption | > 80% | kepano "Properties as links" |

A run against a small synthetic fixture vault ships in [`examples/sample-scorecard.txt`](examples/sample-scorecard.txt). The audit finishes in well under a second on a 3,000-note vault.

## Real before/after

The tool was developed against a 3,000-note vault used during its own design. Concrete data points from the same vault, before and after one audit-driven cleanup cycle:

| Dimension | Day 1 | After cleanup | Grade Day 1 -> After |
|---|---|---|---|
| Orphan rate | 32.2% | 12.0% | D -> B |
| Top-hub edge-share | 31.4% (force-star) | 1.14% | F -> A |
| Frontmatter-wikilink adoption | 6% | 84% | F -> A |
| Louvain modularity | 0.22 | 0.51 | F -> A |
| Overall grade | F | B | F -> B |

The single largest move came from breaking up one mega-hub: a "research" anchor that captured 31% of all edge-weight in the vault. After de-starring and minting topic-specific hubs, top-hub edge-share dropped to 1.14% and modularity climbed from 0.22 to 0.51. The rubric surfaces this kind of structural fix automatically — you don't have to know to look for it.

## How to install

### Python / PyPI (any environment)

```bash
pip install obsidian-graph-auditor
obsidian-graph-audit --vault ~/Documents/MyVault
```

### Claude Code

```bash
pip install obsidian-graph-auditor
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
git clone https://github.com/build-with-dhiraj/obsidian-graph-auditor ~/.claude/skills/obsidian-graph-auditor
```

Then ask: *"audit my obsidian vault at ~/Documents/MyVault"*. Claude Code reads `SKILL.md` and invokes the CLI.

### Cursor

```bash
pip install obsidian-graph-auditor
mkdir -p ~/.cursor/skills
git clone https://github.com/build-with-dhiraj/obsidian-graph-auditor ~/.cursor/skills/obsidian-graph-auditor
```

### Gemini CLI

```bash
pip install obsidian-graph-auditor
mkdir -p ~/.gemini/skills
git clone https://github.com/build-with-dhiraj/obsidian-graph-auditor ~/.gemini/skills/obsidian-graph-auditor
```

### Codex CLI

```bash
pip install obsidian-graph-auditor
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
git clone https://github.com/build-with-dhiraj/obsidian-graph-auditor ~/.codex/skills/obsidian-graph-auditor
```

## CI gate (block regressions)

Save a baseline. On every PR that touches the vault, fail the build if any rubric dimension regresses:

```bash
# In CI, after checking out the vault repo:
obsidian-graph-audit --vault ./vault --json-out audit.json --baseline last-good.json
# Exit code 1 if any dimension dropped a grade vs last-good.json.
```

A GitHub Actions workflow scaffold is in [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml).

## FAQ

### Will this modify my vault?
No. Read-only by design. The auditor only opens files for reading.

### Does it require GPT or any API key?
No. Pure local Python. No network calls.

### What if I use Logseq, Roam, Foam, or Quartz?
Works on any vault that uses `[[wikilinks]]`. The tool reads markdown files plus optional YAML frontmatter and builds the graph from explicit links only.

### How long does it take?
Sub-second for a 3,000-note vault on a modern laptop. The bottleneck is YAML parsing, not graph algorithms.

### What's a "Grade-A" vault?
A vault where every one of the eight rubric dimensions independently grades A. Because the overall grade is the worst dimension, you always see the single most-actionable fix. See [`docs/RUBRIC.md`](docs/RUBRIC.md) for the threshold rationale.

### Can I customize the thresholds?
Yes. Pass `--threshold-config thresholds.yaml` with any subset of dimensions overridden. Example:

```yaml
orphan_pct:
  a: 15.0
  b: 25.0
  c: 35.0
  d: 45.0
```

### Why don't I just look at the Obsidian Graph view?
The Graph view shows you a hairball. It doesn't measure orphan rate, modularity, or hub concentration. You can't tell whether your vault is rotting by squinting at it. The auditor gives you a number.

### Can I run this in CI?
Yes. The `--baseline previous.json` flag exits non-zero on regression. See [CI gate](#ci-gate-block-regressions) above.
