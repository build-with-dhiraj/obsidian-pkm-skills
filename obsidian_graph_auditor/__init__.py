"""obsidian-graph-auditor.

Read-only auditor that scores an Obsidian vault on the 8-dimension Grade-A
rubric (link density, orphan rate, near-orphan rate, connected-2plus share,
top-hub edge-share, top-hub:next ratio, Louvain modularity, frontmatter-wikilink
adoption).

Pure Python. No GPT, no API keys, no plugins. Works on any vault that uses
``[[wikilinks]]`` (Obsidian, Logseq, Foam, Quartz — anything markdown-based).
